# Explore Neighbourhoods in SF </br>
Just type in "coffee" or "burger" or "restaurant" and select a neighbourhood </br>
This app uses the Google Maps Geocode API to retrieve the latitude and longitude of a given neighbourhood</br> and makes a GET request to the FourSquare API to get recommended places along with its images that are around the neighbourhood</br>
</br> The router on the second page (bak to home button) is how I personally like to implement page navigations!
